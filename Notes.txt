Directional light location does not matter, just its degree.
Try and relate the scale to things in real life.
The sizes have been chosen based on the standards for bowling fields. One unit is a cm.
Create new material: Assets -> Create -> Material
Select Main Camera, then GameObject -> Align With Camera to align the camera with your current view.
Need to enable Convex on Mesh Collider to enable collision between other Mesh Colliders.
Camera Far point refers to how far away the camera can see.

Isometric's useful for size comparison. For visual reality use perspective.

Rigidbody is required to add mass and other physics based properties to a component.
To change gravity go under Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics. We've chosen 1 unit to be 1 cm in our game. So the difference is 100x. Have to
modify the gravitiy to match it so from 9.81 it goes to 981.

Convex mesh is a mesh that is curved, bulging outwards not inwards. Mesh colliders must be convex to self-collide e.g. pin with pin. Maximum triangles
in collider is 255. This is due to performance limitations of Unity.

Render texture is to render a camera into a texture instead of directly into your view, becoming the main camera.
Screen Space - Camera makes an element stay with the camera.
